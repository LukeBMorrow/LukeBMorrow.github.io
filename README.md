# Hosting a Markdown Resume on GitHub Pages
In this tutorial, we will make a resume with markdown and host this markdown resume on GitHub pages. This may sound like a lot of work, but markdown can be learned in under an hour, and we will only need a hand-full of tags to make a resume. In this tutorial, these will be the assumptions:  

| Assuming you have | Assuming you do not have  |  
|---|---|  
| Git  |  Atom |  
| GitHub | Markdown Resume |  

 Now, on to the tutorial!

## Stage 1: Installing Atom
Now we are going to install atom for writing our markdown resume.
1. Go to the [Atom Website](https://atom.io/).
2. Download the installer for your computer.
3. Run Setup.  

Welcome to Atom!
Now that you have Atom installed you can start writing your markdown resume.

## Stage 2: Writing Markdown
In this section, I cannot write your resume, but I can give you general guidelines and a markdown guide.
1. Open a file in Atom and save it as _index.md_
  >**Note**: Files name must be _index.md_ for a later step.

2. Write your resume in _index.md_.
  >**Note**: You can also copy your existing resume if you have one.  

  >**Learn Markdown**:
    * [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) will walk you through each markdown tag with examples and practice problems.
    * [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) is made by the creator of markdown, and goes into depth on the conversion that happens between markdown and HTML.
    * [Awesome Markdown](https://github.com/mundimark/awesome-markdown) is a compilation of resources for Markdown, if you want more markdown goodies, such as: "libraries, services, editors, tools, cheatsheets, etc.".
